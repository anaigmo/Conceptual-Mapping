# Conceptual Mapping 

## Purpose and scope

This vocabulary has been developed to gather the expressiveness of current mapping languages that describe the transformation of heterogeneous data sources into RDF. The scope of the vocabulary is to represent description of data sources, their access, mapping rules for RDF transformation and functions.

## Vocabulary development
### Requirements
The requirements of this vocabulary are specified [here](https://github.com/oeg-upm/Conceptual-Mapping/blob/main/requirements/Requirements%20-%20conceptual%20mapping.xlsx).

### Ontology model

The following diagram shows a general overview of the classes and properties of the Conceptual Mapping vocabulary. This diagram follows the [Chowlk notation](https://chowlk.linkeddata.es/notation.html).

### Ontology (OWL)
The encoded ontology in OWL can be found [here](https://github.com/oeg-upm/Conceptual-Mapping/blob/main/ontology/conceptual-mapping.owl). 

## Maintenance
The management of issues and improvements suggested for this vocabulary is done by addressing [issues](https://github.com/oeg-upm/Conceptual-Mapping/issues) in the repository.

## Examples
Some examples of how the language can be used to describe data for RDF transformation is shown in the [examples folder](https://github.com/oeg-upm/Conceptual-Mapping/tree/main/examples).
