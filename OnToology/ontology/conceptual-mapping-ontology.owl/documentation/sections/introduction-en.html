  The Conceptual Mapping aims to gather the expressiveness of declarative mapping languages that
  describe the transformation of heterogeneous data sources into RDF. This ontology-based
  language settles on the assumption that all mapping languages, being used for the basic same
  purpose of describing data sources in terms of an ontology to create RDF, must have some
  basic patterns and inherent shared characteristics across all languages. The Conceptual
  Mapping's model is designed to represent and articulate these core features.

  The scope of the vocabulary is to represent features based on declarative languages for
  describing data sources, their access, mapping rules for RDF transformation and functions.
  It is out of the scope representing the entire expressivenes of "procedural" languages based
  on SPARQL, such as SPARQL-Generate of Facade-X.


<!--The ontology of Conceptual Mappings is a meta-model that represents the concepts
covered by state-of-the-art mapping languages. Mapping languages are used for Knowledge
Graph generation; they establish the correspondence between data sources and a target
ontology that guides the KG construction. However the wide assortment of languages
cover diverse use cases and approaches and hinders an effective use of languages
and tools and mapping reuse. The goal of this ontology is to facilitate and flexibilize the use of
KG tools and mapping languages as this meta-model would support the translation
between mapping languages and can also serve as the basis of different tools.-->
  <!-- The purpose of this vocabulary is to provide a metamodel for describing mapping
  languages. These languages are used in the generation of Knowledge Graphs,
  defining the relationships between the source data to be translated and the
  target ontology that serves as guideline in the transformation. There a wide
  variety of languages with different expressivities, limited for determined
  use cases and approaches. The aim of this model is, then, to gather and
  express the features of the different mapping languages.-->
