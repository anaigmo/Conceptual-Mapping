The Conceptual Mapping ontology defines a model that abstracts the features that
are present in state-of-the-art mapping languages, 
while considering their heterogeneity. The context of this model encompasses Ontology
Based Data Access (OBDA) and Ontology Based Data Integration (OBDI), where data from
several heterogeneous sources need to be accessible according to a unified and global
view. Mappings are used to describe the relationships among the global view and the
data source schemas. The diversity of available mapping languages motivates the
construction of a language that gathers their features to, in the end, be able to
represent them. This can potentially enhance the language interoperability and translation.


<!--The ontology of Conceptual Mappings is a meta-model that represents the concepts
covered by state-of-the-art mapping languages. Mapping languages are used for Knowledge
Graph generation; they establish the correspondence between data sources and a target
ontology that guides the KG construction. However the wide assortment of languages
cover diverse use cases and approaches and hinders an effective use of languages
and tools and mapping reuse. The goal of this ontology is to facilitate and flexibilize the use of
KG tools and mapping languages as this meta-model would support the translation
between mapping languages and can also serve as the basis of different tools.-->
  <!-- The purpose of this vocabulary is to provide a metamodel for describing mapping
  languages. These languages are used in the generation of Knowledge Graphs,
  defining the relationships between the source data to be translated and the
  target ontology that serves as guideline in the transformation. There a wide
  variety of languages with different expressivities, limited for determined
  use cases and approaches. The aim of this model is, then, to gather and
  express the features of the different mapping languages.-->
