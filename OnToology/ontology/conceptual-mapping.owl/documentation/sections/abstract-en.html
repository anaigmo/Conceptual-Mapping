<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The purpose of this vocabulary is to provide a metamodel for describing mapping
languages. These languages are used in the generation of Knowledge Graphs,
defining the relationships between the source data to be translated and the
target ontology that serves as guideline in the transformation. There a wide
variety of languages with different expressivities, limited for determined
use cases and approaches. The aim of this model is, then, to gather and
express the features of the different mapping languages.
